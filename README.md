The Assassin player's goal is traditionally to eliminate all other players by physically tracking them down and performing a ritual "kill" maneuver, typically a physical motion or mark. In our version, a player must check in, using a smartphone's location-tracking function, close to their target to achieve a "kill".<br>
Players can check in as often as they wish to receive the location of their target, but they also give their location to their pursuer. Every player is both target and pursuer.
